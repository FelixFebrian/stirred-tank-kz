# Stirred Tank Simulation

OpenFOAM simulation of stirred tank with focus on the stirrer power number and mixing
time. This study is based on the paper by Kraume, M.; Zehner, P. Experience with
Experimental Standards for Measurements of Various Parameters in Stirred Tanks. Chemical
Engineering Research and Design 2001, 79 (8), 811â€“818.
https://doi.org/10.1205/02638760152721316.

The simulation is done with OpenFOAM v9 - OpenFOAM Foundation version.


## ToDos
- [x] Output `y+` function as histogram.
- [ ] Run mesh study - change the number of cells in `blockMeshDict`.
- [ ] Run the simulations with different stirrer speed.
